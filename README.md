# deep-learning-from-scratch

A set of .py files created during my private study with a textbook on deep-learning
『ゼロから作るDeep Learning』, a.k.a. "Deep Learning from Scratch".

Most of the source files here are based on the official samples of the book
(https://github.com/oreilly-japan/deep-learning-from-scratch),
but some are modified a bit from the original and some are totally new.
Notably with "source files/io_util.py" you can save and restore
learning parameters in case the learning takes too long and you would like to
stop for a while.
